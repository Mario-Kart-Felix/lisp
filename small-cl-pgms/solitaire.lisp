#||
Heuristics:

- remove cards from the highest hidden stacks first.
- remove cards from the lowest stacks to free spaces for a king.
- between two kings of different colors to be put on an empty space,
chose the one that will allow to move a queen (and the bigest number
of cards) next (preferably from the stacks, but otherwise from the stock).

- at the end, if there's nothing else to do, move away cards that free
cards that can go to the foundation.


- end-of-game constraints
