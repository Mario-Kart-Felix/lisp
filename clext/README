com.informatimago.clext Common Lisp Extensions Library
======================================================

This directory contains Common-Lisp packages that are mostly portable,
but that use some extensions, packages out of the Common-Lisp
specifications, like GRAY or other portability libraries.

com.informatimago.clext.association
    This system defines a package exporting macros to define classes
    and associations separately.

com.informatimago.clext.character-sets
    This system defines a package to manage character-sets and
    external-formats portably.

com.informatimago.clext.closer-weak
    This system defines a package providing a portability layer for
    weak pointers and related structures on ccl, clisp, sbcl and cmu.
    
com.informatimago.clext.pipe
    This system defines a package exporting a pipe abstraction
    connecting an output stream to an input stream thru a queue or a
    buffer.  The threads writing or reading are synchronized.
