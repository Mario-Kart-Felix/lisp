;;;;        :WEAK-TEST    When testing, call the garbage collector
;;;;                      to break weak pointers sooner.
;;;;
;;;;        :DEBUG-WEAK   When compiling on clisp, use this implementation
;;;;                      instead of the native one.

Closer to Weak objects.
Implements the specification: <http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/weak.html>
for Common Lisp implementations that have weak-pointers.

WEAK-OR-RELATION is a primitive that cannot be implemented properly
without implementation support.

Currently works on:

  allegro   
  ccl         x    x    x       x   n   -- WHT native.
