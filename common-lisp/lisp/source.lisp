This package manages the book-keeping of source forms for the CL
defining macros.

The source forms are kept in the property list of the symbol naming
the object defined by it.  Defpackage source forms are kept in a
separate hash-table.

The function SOURCE returns the source form of the given symbol for
the given source-type.

The function (setf source) sets the source form of the given symbol for
the given source-type..

The function LIST-PACKAGES-WITH-SOURCES returns a list of packages
where some of these variables or functions are defined.

The function SYMBOLS-WITH-SOURCES returns a list of symbols having
some source attached.

The function LIST-SOURCES returns a list of sources.

The function SAVE-SOURCES saves the definitions in a package, or all
the definitions to a file or stream.
