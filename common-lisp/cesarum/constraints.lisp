A little constraint solver.

Given a graph of nodes, and a propagate function that propagates
constraints from node to nodes, the solver propagates the constraints
until no change occurs.

It computes the strongly connected components, and performs a
topological sort of the condensed graph to minimalize the number of
calls to propagate.
