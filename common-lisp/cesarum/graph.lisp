This package exports classes for elements, sets and graphs.

Graph class.

This is a CLOS based implementation of graphs.
It comes from an emacs/eieio implementation used to analyze
CVS versioning graph.

Subclasses exist to generate dot files, and Diagram! files.

        (NOT COPY-NODES) COPY-EDGE       You get a new graph with new edges,
                                         but the same NODES.
        (NOT COPY-NODES) (NOT COPY-EDGE) You get a new graph with the same
                                         edges and the same NODES. But you
                                         still can add or remove NODES or
                                         edges to make it different from the
                                         original graph.
