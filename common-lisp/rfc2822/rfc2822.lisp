RFC0822/RFC2822 support funtions.

RFC822      STANDARD FOR THE FORMAT OF ARPA INTERNET TEXT MESSAGES
RFC2822     Internet Message Format

RFC822 in fixnum words:

In transmission, message lines are separated by CRLF.
Header lines are separated from body lines by an empty line (CRLFCRLF).
Header lines may be cut by replacing any space or tab by CRLF, (space or tab).
Field name consists of any ASCII printable character but space and colon,
followed by a colon.
Field body begins immediately after the colon. (Customary space included).
NOTE: rfc2822 forbid spaces between field name and colon,
 but it IS possible in rfc822 to insert spaces here.
 (For example, see Annex A of RFC822).
