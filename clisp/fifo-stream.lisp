Returns a character or :EOF, like DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR, if that
would return immediately. If DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR's value is not
available immediately, returns NIL instead of waiting.

The default method simply calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR; this is
sufficient for streams whose DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR method never
blocks.

  "
If a character was pushed back using DEFUN STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR, returns
it. Otherwise returns the next character from the stream, avoiding any
side effects DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR would do. Returns :EOF if the
end-of-stream is reached.

The default method calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR and DEFUN
STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR; this is sufficient for streams whose DEFUN
STREAM-READ-CHAR method has no side-effects.

(defmethod stream-listen ((stream fifo-stream))
  "
If a character was pushed back using DEFUN STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR, returns it. Otherwise returns the next character from the stream, if already available. If no character is available immediately, or if end-of-stream is reached, returns NIL.

The default method calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR-NO-HANG and DEFUN STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR; this is sufficient for streams whose DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR method has no side-effects.

(defmethod stream-read-char-will-hang-p ((stream fifo-stream))

Returns NIL if DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR will return immediately. Otherwise it returns true.

The default method calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR-NO-HANG and DEFUN STREAM-UNREAD-CHAR; this is sufficient for streams whose DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR method has no side-effects.

This function is a CLISP extension (see EXT:READ-CHAR-WILL-HANG-P).

  "
Fills the subsequence of sequence specified by :START and :END with
characters consecutively read from stream. Returns the index of the
first element of sequence that was not updated (= end or < end if the
stream reached its end).

sequence is an array of characters, i.e. a string. start is a
nonnegative integer and default to 0. end is a nonnegative integer or
NIL and defaults to NIL, which stands for (LENGTH sequence).

The default method repeatedly calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR; this is
always sufficient if speed does not matter.

This function is a CLISP extension (see EXT:READ-CHAR-SEQUENCE)

(defmethod stream-read-line ((stream fifo-stream))
  "
Reads a line of characters, and return two values: the line (a string, without the terminating #\Newline character), and a boolean value which is true if the line was terminated by end-of-stream instead of #\Newline.

The default method repeatedly calls DEFUN STREAM-READ-CHAR; this is always sufficient.
"

  )


(defmethod stream-clear-input ((stream fifo-stream))
  "
Clears all pending interactive input from the stream, and returns true if some pending input was removed.

The default method does nothing and returns NIL; this is sufficient for non-interactive streams.

(defmethod stream-write-char ((stream fifo-stream) (char character))
  "
Writes char.

You must define a method for this function.

  )


(defmethod stream-line-column ((stream fifo-stream))
  "
Returns the column number where the next character would be written (0 stands for the first column), or NIL if that is not meaningful for this stream.

You must define a method for this function.

#|||
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-START-LINE-P STREAM)

RETURNS TRUE IF THE NEXT CHARACTER WOULD BE WRITTEN AT THE START OF A NEW LINE.

THE DEFAULT METHOD CALLS DEFUN STREAM-LINE-COLUMN AND COMPARES ITS RESULT WITH 0; this is sufficient for streams whose DEFUN STREAM-LINE-COLUMN never returns NIL.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE STREAM SEQUENCE &OPTIONAL [START [END]])

OUTPUTS THE SUBSEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE SPECIFIED BY :START AND :END TO STREAM.

SEQUENCE IS AN ARRAY OF CHARACTERS, I.E. A STRING. START IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER AND DEFAULT TO 0. END IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER OR NIL AND DEFAULTS TO NIL, WHICH STANDS FOR (LENGTH SEQUENCE).

THE DEFAULT METHOD REPEATEDLY CALLS DEFUN STREAM-WRITE-CHAR; this is always sufficient if speed does not matter.

THIS FUNCTION IS A CLISP EXTENSION (SEE EXT:WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE)
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-WRITE-STRING STREAM STRING &OPTIONAL [START [END]])

OUTPUTS THE SUBSEQUENCE OF STRING SPECIFIED BY :START AND :END TO STREAM. RETURNS STRING.

STRING IS A STRING. START IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER AND DEFAULT TO 0. END IS A NONNEGATIVE INTEGER OR NIL AND DEFAULTS TO NIL, WHICH STANDS FOR (LENGTH STRING).

THE DEFAULT METHOD CALLS DEFUN STREAM-WRITE-CHAR-SEQUENCE; this is always sufficient.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-TERPRI STREAM)

OUTPUTS A #\NEWLINE CHARACTER.

THE DEFAULT METHOD CALLS DEFUN STREAM-WRITE-CHAR; this is always sufficient.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-FRESH-LINE STREAM)

POSSIBLY OUTPUTS A #\NEWLINE CHARACTER, SO AS TO ENSURE THAT THE NEXT CHARACTER WOULD BE WRITTEN AT THE START OF A NEW LINE. RETURNS TRUE IF IT DID OUTPUT A #\NEWLINE CHARACTER.

THE DEFAULT METHOD CALLS DEFUN STREAM-START-LINE-P AND THEN DEFUN STREAM-TERPRI IF NECESSARY ; this is always sufficient.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-FINISH-OUTPUT STREAM)

ENSURES THAT ANY BUFFERED OUTPUT HAS REACHED ITS DESTINATION, AND THEN RETURNS.

THE DEFAULT METHOD DOES NOTHING.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT STREAM)

BRINGS ANY BUFFERED OUTPUT ON ITS WAY TOWARDS ITS DESTINATION, AND RETURNS WITHOUT WAITING UNTIL IT HAS REACHED ITS DESTINATION.

THE DEFAULT METHOD DOES NOTHING.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT STREAM)

ATTEMPTS TO DISCARD ANY BUFFERED OUTPUT WHICH HAS NOT YET REACHED ITS DESTINATION.

THE DEFAULT METHOD DOES NOTHING.
(DEFMETHOD STREAM-ADVANCE-TO-COLUMN STREAM COLUMN)

ENSURES THAT THE NEXT CHARACTER WILL BE WRITTEN AT COLUMN AT LEAST.

THE DEFAULT METHOD OUTPUTS AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF SPACE CHARACTERS ; this is sufficient for non-proportional output.
