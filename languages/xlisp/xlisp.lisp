;;;;SYSTEM:             Common-Lisp
;;;;USER-INTERFACE:     NONE
;;;;DESCRIPTION
;;;;    
;;;;    This is an implementation of xlisp 3.0 (1997) written as a
;;;;    Common Lisp package.
;;;;
;;;;    To keep it simple, we don't support continuations and
;;;;    environments, but they could be added in a later version.  We
;;;;    don't export internal functions either (whose names start with %).
